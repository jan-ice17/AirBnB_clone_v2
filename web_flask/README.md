# AirBnB Clone - Web Framework

## Project Overview
This project is part of the AirBnB clone series, focusing on developing a web framework using Python's Flask. The goal is to replicate the functionality and user experience of the popular Airbnb platform by creating a robust web server to handle requests and deliver dynamic content.
